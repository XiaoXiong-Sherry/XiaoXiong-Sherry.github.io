Welcome to my academic portfolio! My name is Xiao Xiong, and I am passionate about exploring AI-related fields. I hold an MPhil in Data Intensive Science from the University of Cambridge. Prior to that, I earned a BSc in Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Physics from Imperial College London.

My research focuses on advanced topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning, including generative models and large language models (LLMs), with a particular emphasis on their reasoning capabilities and explainability. I also interest in theorem proving using tools like Lean4, with a focus on AI safety. Additionally, I work on reinforcement learning, path-finding, and multi-agent systems. I am particularly passionate about exploring the intersections between cognitive science and deep learning.
